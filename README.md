# Personal Website

This is my updated personal portfolio website - May, 2017.

## How to access

https://divijmehra.herokuapp.com.
Best used with Google Chrome.

## Design

Not a lot of design process was used to make this portfolio - mainly due to time constraints! I simply wanted to improve from my earlier attempt, and hence in terms of structure and info, it is quite similar to the one I made first a few months ago (https://github.com/divijm/CFA-Personal-Portfolio)!

I did however want to make a much more simpler, easy-on-the-eyes viewing and hence have gone for a grey-ish colour scheme which makes it seem professional in my opinion.

Furthermore, multiple code snippets from themes and other people's sample/source code were taken to compile this website - to reduce the time it took to finish this project! :) 

## Logo

I wanted to create a logo which I can re-use in any projects I do later on in my web design career - and I feel like the one here is at it's first iteration!

## Typography and Icons

I used Google Fonts:
- Montserrat

Icons:
- Font Awesome (http://fontawesome.io/icons/)

## Coding  

Getting started from scratch was much more quicker for me compared to last time when I made the portfolio website! This was quite a pleasant surprise for me - definitely shows my coding improvement over the last few months! :)

Last time when making the website, I struggled with alignment quite a bit! I also struggled a lot with minor niggles that took too much time (like color schemes, margins etc). With some experience now and having built some working knowledge of HTML/CSS I felt that I zoomed past those hurdles by being either referencing my other projects or Googling the right problems to find the correct solution much faster!

Things to improve upon:
- Easier integration of projects - rather than me going into the code to add projects manually!
- Image hover with text
- Improve responsiveness (pretty responsive but could improve!)
- Better typography (didn't really look into this too much)
- Include my thoughts
- Loading times

## Looking ahead

This website is my second attempt at a personal portfolio. I am much more pleased with this effort as it relays the projects and myself much more effectively. It is still quite simple technically, so as I progress through my web development journey - I hope to add more Javascript and other slick-looking features soon!

Hope you enjoy! :)
